## password-generator

## This site demonstrates a password generator I made using javascript with html and css as part of my University of Arizona Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. 

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I had was trying to utilize the concepts I learned in class to the challenge itself. Learning something conceptually is alot different from trying something yourself.

I had to lookup many things, watch youtube videos and refer to the mini-project to get ideas and look up examples.

## Next Steps

I will continue to learn and use javascript for the remainder of the course. I have a basic idea of how it works on the front-end and it will be interesting to see how it works on the back-end as well.
